# Venmo Manual Payment Tracking Guide

This guide explains how the manual Venmo payment tracking system works in the HOA Community App.

## Overview

The app now uses **manual Venmo payment tracking** as the primary payment method. Residents submit their payment information through the app, and HOA board members manually verify payments in the Venmo app before approving them in the system.

## Payment Flow

### For Residents (Homeowners)

**Step 1: Access Payment**
- Navigate to the "Fees & Fines" screen from the main menu
- View your outstanding fees or fines
- Click "Pay Now" on the item you want to pay

**Step 2: Choose Venmo Payment**
- Payment modal opens with payment options
- **Venmo is the default payment method** (shown first)
- Venmo payment option displays the HOA's Venmo username: **@sheltonsprings-HOA**

**Step 3: Pay in Venmo App**
- Open your Venmo mobile app or go to venmo.com
- Search for **@sheltonsprings-HOA**
- Send the payment for the exact amount shown
- **IMPORTANT**: In the note/memo, include what you're paying for (e.g., "Annual Fee 2025")

**Step 4: Copy Transaction ID**
- After sending the payment in Venmo
- Find the transaction ID in your Venmo transaction history
- The transaction ID is usually shown in the URL or on the transaction receipt

**Step 5: Submit Payment Info in App**
- Return to the payment modal in the HOA app
- Enter your Venmo username
- Paste or type the transaction ID from Venmo
- Click "Submit Payment Info"
- You'll see a confirmation message

**Step 6: Wait for Verification**
- Your payment status will be "Pending" until verified by HOA staff
- You'll receive a notification when your payment is verified
- The fee/fine will be marked as "Paid" once verified

## For HOA Board Members (Admin)

### Accessing Payment Management

**Step 1: Open Admin Screen**
- You must be logged in as a board member or developer
- Click on "Admin" from the main navigation menu

**Step 2: Navigate to Payments Tab**
- In the admin screen, find the "Payments" section
- You'll see two tabs:
  - **Venmo Payments** - Manual Venmo payments awaiting verification
  - **PayPal Payments** - Automated PayPal payments (if used)

### Verifying Venmo Payments

**Step 1: Review Pending Payments**
- Click on "Venmo Payments" tab
- You'll see a list of all payments with status "Pending"
- For each payment, you'll see:
  - Resident's name
  - Venmo username (the resident)
  - Transaction ID
  - Amount
  - Fee type (e.g., "Annual Fee", "Late Fee")
  - Date submitted

**Step 2: Verify in Venmo**
- Open your Venmo app or go to venmo.com
- Log in to the HOA Venmo account (@sheltonsprings-HOA)
- Navigate to your transaction history
- Search for the transaction ID or amount provided
- Verify:
  - The payment amount matches
  - The sender matches the resident's Venmo username
  - The payment is actually in your Venmo account

**Step 3: Approve or Reject**
- If payment is verified:
  - Click the "Verify" or "Approve" button
  - Payment status changes to "Verified" and "Paid"
  - The associated fee or fine is automatically marked as "Paid"
  
- If payment cannot be verified:
  - Click the "Reject" button
  - Enter a rejection reason (optional)
  - Payment status changes to "Rejected"
  - Resident is notified and can resubmit

**Step 4: Notification**
- Once verified or rejected, the resident receives an automatic notification
- Payment history is updated in the system

## Best Practices

### For Residents

1. **Use the exact payment amount** shown in the app
2. **Include a description** in the Venmo payment note (e.g., "Annual Fee - Unit 123")
3. **Copy the transaction ID exactly** - double-check for typos
4. **Keep the Venmo receipt** until payment is verified
5. **Allow time for verification** - HOA staff may not check payments immediately

### For HOA Staff

1. **Check payments regularly** - Aim to verify within 24-48 hours
2. **Verify all details** before approving:
   - Amount matches exactly
   - Date aligns with resident's submission
   - Transaction ID matches
3. **Communicate issues immediately** - If a payment is rejected, notify the resident
4. **Keep Venmo secure** - Only board members should have access to the HOA Venmo account
5. **Document discrepancies** - If payments don't match, note it for follow-up

## Venmo Account Information

**HOA Venmo Username:** @sheltonsprings-HOA

**Who Has Access:**
- Board members with admin privileges
- Ensure secure access and rotate credentials if needed

## Troubleshooting

### Payment Not Found

**If you can't find a payment in Venmo:**
- Check if the resident entered the transaction ID correctly
- Verify the payment was sent to the correct account (@sheltonsprings-HOA)
- Check if payment is still pending in Venmo (can take a few minutes)
- Verify the amount matches exactly

### Transaction ID Issues

**If transaction ID is unclear:**
- Ask the resident to check their Venmo transaction history
- The ID is usually in the URL of the transaction page
- Can also find it on the Venmo receipt/confirmation email
- Format usually looks like a long alphanumeric string

### Payment Amount Mismatch

**If amount doesn't match:**
- Contact the resident to verify the correct amount
- Do not approve payments with mismatched amounts
- Resident will need to send a new payment for the difference (as a separate transaction)

### Rejected Payments

**After rejecting a payment:**
- State a clear rejection reason
- Resident can resubmit with correct information
- If payment was actually received, they should check with Venmo support

## Security Notes
